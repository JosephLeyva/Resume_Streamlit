## Run it locally
I have created a Docker Compose file, so you don't need to install the packages.

Just go into the root folder, where should be the `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```[bash]
docker compose up
```

It will create the Image with the Python dependences and the container itself.

To view the Page, just go to your browser of preference and type `http://localhost:8501`.
