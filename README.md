Personal Landing Page with Professional Information.

My Resume, Skills, Projects & Accomplishments

## Live Resume
You can check my CV hosted on Streamlit [here](https://josephleyva.streamlit.app/)!

## Run it locally
I have created a Docker Compose file, so you don't need to install the packages.

Just go into the root folder, where should be the `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```[bash]
docker compose up
```

It will create the Image with the Python dependences and the container itself.

To view the Page, just go to your browser of preference and type `http://localhost:8501`.
